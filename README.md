# 🍀 Chat with Everything

### ♥️ A Few Words from the Heart
No one wants to be left out of the booming AI trend, and I am no exception. I dove into learning and soon became overwhelmed by a sea of technological knowledge. There is so much to learn, contemplate, and systematize.

**"Chat with Everything"** is a series of practical exercises ranging from easy to difficult for those new to LLM apps. I write it based on my experiences from months of research and learning. I hope it will be useful for your journey!
