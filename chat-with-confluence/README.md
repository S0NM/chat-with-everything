📚 Chat with Confluence

### **Level**: Beginner 🎖️ 

### 1. Our Goal 🎯

Confluence is a tool used as a wiki by many companies. If we consider Confluence as a knowledge repository, providing a tool to access this repository is very important. In this application, I will show you:

* How to access and load content from this knowledge repository 
* A Q&A chatbot to interact with this knowledge repository

**Tech Stack**

- Streamlit
- Langchain ([Working with Confluence Lodaer](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/integrations/document_loaders/confluence/))

Take a look at the following demo to understand what we will achieve :)):
